Windows script to fix and repair windows components

Just click on these bat files as admin to 

* fix_windows -> scan and restore your current windows image by the recommended one
* get_last_exception_bdos -> get last blue screen logs
* reset_windows_update -> in case of windows update failure, this will reset your windows update so that you can start over

All of these scripts require a restart afterward
